Online Banking Applicaion
"My online banking application is built using Spring Boot for the backend, providing core banking services like account management and transaction handling. The React frontend offers an interactive user interface for tasks like checking balances, transferring money, and viewing transaction history. Kafka is integrated for real-time, asynchronous communication between services, especially for transaction processing and notifications. Additionally, Iâ€™m using Spring Cloud Config to manage centralized application configurations, ensuring seamless and dynamic configuration management across different environments."
